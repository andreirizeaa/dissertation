# Andrei's Writing Style Guide

This document defines my writing style for academic and professional documents. Use this as the reference for all writing in this project.

---

## Voice and Perspective

### First Person Usage
- Use "I" when describing my choices, actions, or opinions
- Use "I" for methodology sections explaining what I did and why
- Use "we" sparingly, only when genuinely referring to a group
- Avoid the royal "we" as a substitute for "I"

### Active Voice
- Prefer active voice in most situations
- Reserve passive voice for when the actor is genuinely unknown or unimportant
- Active voice creates clearer, more direct sentences

### Tone
- Conversational but professional
- Confident without being arrogant
- Explain rather than impress
- Direct without being blunt
- Honest about limitations and uncertainties
- Never condescending to the reader

---

## Sentence Structure

### Length
- Short to medium sentences (15-25 words typical)
- Break complex ideas across multiple sentences
- One main idea per sentence
- Occasional longer sentences for flow, but avoid multi-clause constructions

### Clarity
- Subject-verb-object structure where possible
- Put the main point early in the sentence
- Avoid nested clauses
- Avoid sentences that require re-reading

### Rhythm
- Vary sentence length for natural flow
- Use short sentences for emphasis
- Follow complex explanations with simple summary sentences

---

## Paragraph Structure

### Organisation
- Lead with the main point (topic sentence)
- Support with evidence or explanation
- One theme per paragraph
- Short to medium paragraphs (3-6 sentences typical)

### Flow Between Paragraphs
- Clear logical progression
- Each paragraph should connect to the next
- Use transition sentences at paragraph boundaries when needed

---

## Vocabulary

### General Principles
- Choose the simpler word when two options exist
- Use concrete words over abstract ones
- Use familiar words over obscure ones
- Technical terms are fine when necessary, but define them on first use
- Avoid words that sound impressive but add nothing

## Transitions and Connectors

### Preferred Transitions
- This is because...
- That said...
- On top of that...
- The key point is...
- In other words...
- Put simply...
- More specifically...
- For example...
- However...
- At the same time...
- In practice...
- The result is...
- This means that...
- Looking at this another way...
- To put this in context...

### Transitions to Use Sparingly
- Furthermore (formal)
- Moreover (formal)
- Nevertheless (formal)
- Notwithstanding (very formal)
- Henceforth (archaic)
- Thereby (legalistic)
- Wherein (legalistic)
- Whereby (legalistic)

---

## Technical Writing

### Explaining Complex Concepts
- Start with the simple version, then add detail
- Use analogies to connect unfamiliar concepts to familiar ones
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Use parenthetical asides for brief clarifications
- Break complex explanations into numbered steps when appropriate

### Handling Uncertainty
- Be honest about what is not known
- Use "may", "could", "might" appropriately
- Avoid false precision
- Acknowledge limitations directly

### Citations and Evidence
- Integrate citations smoothly into sentences
- Explain why the cited work matters, not just that it exists
- Summarise key findings in plain language

---

## British English Conventions

### Spelling
- -ise endings (realise, organise, recognise, analyse)
- -our endings (colour, behaviour, favour, honour)
- -re endings (centre, metre, theatre)
- -ence endings where applicable (defence, licence as noun)
- travelled, modelling, cancelled (double l)
- programme (not program, unless referring to computer programs)
- grey (not gray)

### Punctuation
- Single quotation marks for quotes ('like this')
- Double quotation marks for quotes within quotes
- Punctuation outside quotation marks unless part of the quote
- Oxford comma optional but be consistent (I use it)
- No full stop after contractions (Mr, Dr, Mrs)

### Date Format
- Day Month Year (19 January 2026)
- No ordinal suffixes (19 January, not 19th January)

---

## Formatting Preferences

### Lists
- Numbered lists for sequential steps or ranked items
- Bullet points for non-sequential items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Use lists to break up dense prose

### Tables
- Use tables for comparisons between options
- Use tables for structured data (requirements, risks, etc.)
- Keep tables simple and readable
- Include clear column headers

### Headings
- Clear, descriptive headings
- Consistent hierarchy
- Not too many levels of nesting

---

## What to Avoid

### Overwriting
- Do not pad sentences with unnecessary words
- Do not repeat the same point in different words
- Do not add qualifiers that weaken the statement
- Do not use three words when one will do

### Academic Stuffiness
- Avoid jargon for its own sake
- Avoid overly formal constructions
- Avoid impersonal constructions when first person is clearer
- Avoid showing off vocabulary

### Hedging Excessively
- Do not weaken every statement with "perhaps", "somewhat", "relatively"
- State conclusions directly when the evidence supports them
- Reserve hedging for genuine uncertainty

### Clichés
- Avoid overused phrases (at the end of the day, going forward, best practice)
- Avoid business jargon (leverage, synergise, disrupt)
- Avoid filler phrases (it goes without saying, needless to say)

---

## Document-Specific Guidelines

### Dissertations and Reports
- Introduction should set context clearly and state what the document covers
- Each section should have a clear purpose
- Conclusions should summarise findings, not introduce new material
- Keep methodology sections practical and justified

### Requirements and Specifications
- Be precise and unambiguous
- Use consistent terminology
- Make requirements testable where possible

---

## Summary Checklist

When reviewing writing, check:
- [ ] Is this in active voice where possible?
- [ ] Are sentences short and clear?
- [ ] Have I used simple words?
- [ ] Is the main point early in each paragraph?
- [ ] Have I cut unnecessary words?
- [ ] Does this sound like a person talking, not a textbook?
- [ ] Is technical jargon defined or avoided?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth and natural?
- [ ] Is this honest about limitations?
- [ ] Would I actually say this out loud?

## Project Workflow

### Writing Process
- Before writing or editing any content in `diss.tex`, run `/humanizer` on the text to remove AI writing patterns and ensure natural, human-sounding prose

### LaTeX Compilation
- After every edit to `diss.tex`, recompile the PDF by running:
  ```
  pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode diss.tex
  ```
